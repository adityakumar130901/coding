Base Cases: If any of the string is null then LCS will be 0.

Check if ith character in one string A is equal to jth character in string B

Case 1: both characters are same

LCS[i][j] = 1 + LCS[i-1][j-1] (add 1 to the result and remove the last character from both the strings and check the result for the smaller string.)

Case 2: both characters are not same.

LCS[i][j] = 0

At the end, traverse the matrix and find the maximum element in it, This will the length of Longest Common Substring.

Matrix Approach

 - Diagional move ensures we are making one char advance on both strings
 
 - Right travesered ie str[i][j+1] means column string is traversed
 
 - Down Traversed ie str[i+1][j] mean row string is traversed
 
 soln:
 
 if(A[i-1]==B[j-1])
 {
      LCS[i][j] =  LCS[i-1][j-1] +1;
  }
  else
  {
			 LCS[i][j] = 0;					
	}
