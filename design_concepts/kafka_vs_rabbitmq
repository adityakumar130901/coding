Kafka vs RabbitMq

- kakfa is preferred in our project since it provides message ordering which is reqd by our fraud project. RabbitMq does not support ordering

- kafka is a log which means messages are always there. rabbitmq is a queue so msgs are gone once read and acknowledged

- kafka guarantees atomicity as whole batch of msgs either pass or fail. rabbitmq does not gurantee atomicity

- kafka supports replays which is not supported by rabbitmq

- our service may go down hence we need replay support

- matching tool used rabbitmq hence ordering was needed and any consumer which consumed the msg it is no longer reqd

- kafka is faster as it uses sequential disk I/O to boost performance. rabbitmq can also process many msgs but needs more resource

- kafka is faster since it has concept of partitions and multiple borkers etc
